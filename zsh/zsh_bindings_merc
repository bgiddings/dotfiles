## This allows incremental completion of a word.
## After starting this command, a list of completion
## choices can be shown after every character you
## type, which you can delete with ^h or DEL.
## RET will accept the completion so far.
## You can hit TAB to do normal completion, ^g to            
## abort back to the state when you started, and ^d to list the matches.

## This set of functions implements a sort of magic history searching.
## After predict-on, typing characters causes the editor to look backward
## in the history for the first line beginning with what you have typed so
## far.  After predict-off, editing returns to normal for the line found.
## In fact, you often don't even need to use predict-off, because if the
## line doesn't match something in the history, adding a key performs
## standard completion - though editing in the middle is liable to delete
## the rest of the line.
